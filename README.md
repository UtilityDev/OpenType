# OpenType
A Python package for making easy typewriter effects!

#  To get started ðŸ”¥
1. Download the ```opentype.py``` file and add the file to your project directory.
2. Import opentype with 'from opentype import Typewriter'
3. Create a variable called ```t``` set to an instance of the ```Typewriter()``` class from ```opentype.py``` and specify a typing speed (would recommend a positive number between 0.01 & 0.1).
4. Use ```t.type("whatever")``` to type!
5. You can also choose to add a line-break as a second parameter (this is set to ```True``` by default)
6. **Thats it! :)**
